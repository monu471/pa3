    "#### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of an abstract superclass is to provide a common interface for the subclasses. It defines the methods that the subclasses should implement, but does not provide an implementation for them. This allows the subclasses to share a common interface, but to provide their own implementation of the methods\n",
    "abstract classes are defined using the abc (abstract base classes) module and decorated with @abstractmethod."

    "\n",
    "When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, the assignment statement creates a class-level variable with the specified name and assigns the specified value to it. This variable is available for use within the class and its methods."

    "### 3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass __init__ method?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class needs to manually call a superclass's init method because when a subclass is instantiated, the subclass's init method is executed, but the superclass's init method is not automatically called. If the superclass's init method sets up important state for the class, that state will not be initialized if the subclass does not explicitly call the superclass's init method.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calling the superclass's init method, the subclass is able to initialize the superclass's state and any additional state the subclass needs to set up."

    "\n",
    "To augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method, you can use the super() function to call the inherited method, and then add additional functionality after it. This way the inherited method's functionality is preserved, while additional functionality is added."
